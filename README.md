### Meeting 1
The first meeting was mostly focused on setting up the environement as well as some of the logistical stuff, like trello. Additionally, we organized a weekly meeting time of Thursday afternoon for a proper in person meeting. The online/slack meetings have yet to be decided. By next week, the goal is to have the layout and more straightforward views finished. For next week's meeting, the plan is to figure out what exactly the workload/workflow will be for each of the controllers that we need to implement, as almost all the distinct functionality is managed by some API. We also need to start define the objects that we'll be creating/working with in terms of passing user data between server, application, and the multiple views the application has.
